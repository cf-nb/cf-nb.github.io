If one were to ask a semigroup theorist how they would define <em>combinatorial semigroup theory</em>, one answer which one may well receive is something along the lines of: "combinatorial semigroup theory is to semigroup theory what combinatorial group theory is to group theory". Of course, while this definition is helpful if one knows combinatorial group theory well (and many more know much more about this), it is entirely useless if one does not. Furthermore, it seems to go about things backwards; a group is a semigroup, but not the other way around! Therefore, in an ideal world the area of combinatorial group theory ought to be regarded as a subfield of combinatorial semigroup theory, with some more techniques that work in the very special case that the semigroup under consideration is, in fact, a group. The purpose of these series of posts, of which this will be the first, is not to convince the reader that the above view is correct. Nor is it to take a deep dive into the intricacies of combinatorial group theory, with no helping hand beyond referencing standard literature on the subject. Instead, the reader will be assumed to know nothing about semigroups, and the only thing that will be presented will be a gentle [saunter](https://www.etymonline.com/columns/post/john-muir-and-'saunter') starting with the very origins of the area, and highlighting some of the important branches that have appeared. It is my sincere hope that anyone with even an inkling of an interest in general semigroup theory or combinatorial group theory will be fascinated by the beauty of the results and techniques that combinatorial semigroup theory provides.

The name <em>combinatorial group theory</em>, which even has its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_group_theory), was first used by W. Magnus, A. Karrass, and D. Solitar in 1966, in their masterpiece <em>Combinatorial Group Theory: Presentations of Groups in Terms of Generators and Relations</em>. Their justification is given in the preface as "The name 'Combinatorial Group Theory' refers to the frequent occurrence of combinatorial methods, which seem to be characteristic of this discipline." But these combinatorial methods were not created in this book. Nor did they arise in 1930, in arguably the most important article of combinatorial group theory (Magnus' PhD thesis on one-relator groups).
