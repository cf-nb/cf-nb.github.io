If one were to ask a semigroup theory as to how they would define <em>combinatorial semigroup theory</em>, the answer one may get is: "combinatorial semigroup theory is to semigroup theory what combinatorial group theory is to group theory". Of course, while this definition is helpful if one knows combinatorial group theory well (and many more know much more about this), it is entirely useless if one does not. Furthermore, it seems to go about things backwards; a group is a semigroup, but not the other way around! Therefore, in an ideal world the area of combinatorial group theory ought to be regarded as a subfield of combinatorial semigroup theory, with some more techniques that work in the very special case that the semigroup under consideration is, in fact, a group. 

The purpose of these series of posts, of which this will be the first, is not to convince the reader that the above view is correct. Nor is it to take a deep dive into the intricacies of combinatorial group theory, with no helping hand beyond referencing standard literature on the subject. 

The name <em>combinatorial group theory</em> was first used by W. Magnus, A. Karrass, and D. Solitar in 1966, in their masterpiece <em>Combinatorial Group Theory: Presentations of Groups in Terms of Generators and Relations</em>. Their justification is given in the preface as "The name 'Combinatorial Group Theory' refers to the frequent occurrence of combinatorial methods, which seem to be characteristic of this discipline."
