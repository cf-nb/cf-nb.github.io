If one were to ask a semigroup theory as to how they would define <em>combinatorial semigroup theory</em>, the answer one may get is: "combinatorial semigroup theory is to semigroup theory what combinatorial group theory is to group theory". Of course, while this definition is helpful if one knows combinatorial group theory well (and many more know much more about this), it is entirely useless if one does not. Furthermore, it seems 

The name <em>combinatorial group theory</em> was first used by W. Magnus, A. Karrass, and D. Solitar in 1966, in their masterpiece <em>Combinatorial Group Theory: Presentations of Groups in Terms of Generators and Relations</em>. Their justification is given in the preface as "The name <em>Combinatorial Group Theory</em> refers to the frequent occurrence of combinatorial methods, which seem to be characteristic of this discipline."
