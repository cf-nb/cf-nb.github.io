If one were to ask a semigroup theorist how they would define <em>combinatorial semigroup theory</em>, one answer which one may well receive is something along the lines of: "combinatorial semigroup theory is to semigroup theory what combinatorial group theory is to group theory". Of course, while this definition is helpful if one knows combinatorial group theory well (and many more know much more about this), it is entirely useless if one does not. Furthermore, it seems to go about things backwards; a group is a semigroup, but not the other way around! Therefore, in an ideal world the area of combinatorial group theory ought to be regarded as a subfield of combinatorial semigroup theory, with some more techniques that work in the very special case that the semigroup under consideration is, in fact, a group. The purpose of these series of posts, of which this will be the first, is not to convince the reader that the above view is correct. Nor is it to take a deep dive into the intricacies of combinatorial group theory, with no helping hand beyond referencing standard literature on the subject. Instead, the reader will be assumed to know nothing about semigroups, and the only thing that will be presented will be a gentle [saunter](https://www.etymonline.com/columns/post/john-muir-and-'saunter') starting with the very origins of the area, and highlighting some of the important branches that have appeared. It is my sincere hope that anyone with even an inkling of an interest in general semigroup theory or combinatorial group theory will be fascinated by the beauty of the results and techniques that combinatorial semigroup theory provides.

The name <em>combinatorial group theory</em>, which even has its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_group_theory), was first used by W. Magnus, A. Karrass, and D. Solitar in 1966, in their masterpiece <em>Combinatorial Group Theory: Presentations of Groups in Terms of Generators and Relations</em>. Their justification is given in the preface as "The name 'Combinatorial Group Theory' refers to the frequent occurrence of combinatorial methods, which seem to be characteristic of this discipline." But these combinatorial methods were not created in this book. Instead, they herald from the late 1800s and early 1900s, during which time the intermingling of topology and group theory was becoming one of the most fascinating matchups in the history of mathematics. It is during this time that we see the first formalisation of a <em>group presentation</em> by von Dyck in 1882, the ground-breaking work of H. Tietze on their formal transformations in 1908, and the formulation by M. Dehn of the <em>word, conjugacy</em>, and <em>isomorphism problems</em> in 1914. These mathematicians were all very clearly inspired by the topological underpinnings, which have been written about extensively by many. 

There was however a clique of this development which was not driven by topology. A Norwegian mathematician by the name of Axel Thue (1863-1922), an academic grandson of Sophus Lie and academic father of Thoralf Skolem, made a series of remarkable contributions, seemingly out of thin air, to the area that would be later known as combinatorial semigroup theory. This first post, then, will expose some of his work in a modern framework. Importantly, however, I will not make a grand effort to modernise his papers or elaborate on his arguments in a modern style. Rather, I will introduce <em>rewriting systems</em> or, as they are commonly called, <em>Thue systems</em>, and use them to introduce how much more natural the questions of combinatorial semigroup theory is compared to its group counterpart. 

We begin with some definitions. An <em>alphabet</em> <strong>A</strong> is simply any finite set of symbols at our disposal. Since the set is finite, we will generally write it <strong>A = {a, b, c, ...}</strong>.

a given wire happens to be carrying "$$\lvert 0\rangle$$."
By that we mean that it's carrying the linear combination
